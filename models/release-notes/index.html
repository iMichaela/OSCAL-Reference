This release removes the use of this syntax in favor of a simple array of objects. See issue <a href=https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/914>usnistgov/OSCAL#914</a>.</p></li><li><p>In prior OSCAL releases, the data types used in the OSCAL XML and JSON schemas did not require that provided strings are non-empty (see issue <a href=https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/805>usnistgov/OSCAL#805</a>), and leading and trailing whitespace was also allowed (see issue <a href=https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/805>usnistgov/OSCAL#805</a>). Some XML parsers that are schema aware are capable of removing this extra whitespace based on the <code>whiteSpace="collapse"</code> schema facet. This only works if the parser is schema aware. To normalize this behavior across all parsers, the OSCAL string data types will now not allow leading and trailing whitespace.</p><p>This led to updates to the string data types in XML and JSON. The <code>ncname</code> data type was also replaced by <code>token</code> (see issue <a href=https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/issues/911>usnistgov/OSCAL#911</a>).</p></li></ul><h3 id=changes-to-profile-model>Changes to Profile Model</h3><p>In /profile/modify/alter (<a href=../../reference/latest/profile/json-reference/#/profile/modify/alters>JSON/YAML</a>, <a href=../../reference/latest/profile/xml-reference/#/profile/modify/alter>XML</a>) the following changes were made.

Extended data can still be provided using <code>link</code> declarations to external content. This decision can be revisited in future revisions once there is more implementation experience with the OSCAL models.</li><li>Added the following <code>link</code> relations: <code>latest-version</code>, <code>predecessor-version</code>, and <code>successor-version</code> to allow an OSCAL document to link to latest, previous, and next document revisions.</li><li>Fixed a few bugs in the profile resolver code and updated the resolver to work with new profile import/insert structures.</li><li>Provided support for data insertion points for data other than parameters in markup content.</li></ul><h3 id=changes-common-to-all-models>Changes common to all models</h3><ul><li>&ldquo;props&rdquo; and &ldquo;annotations&rdquo; in JSON, and &ldquo;prop&rdquo; and &ldquo;annotation&rdquo; in XML, have been merged into a single property that now allows an optional <code>remark</code> and <code>uuid</code>. Semantically, the optional <code>remark</code> and <code>uuid</code> were the only difference between a &ldquo;prop&rdquo; and an &ldquo;annotation&rdquo; in OSCAL. The resulting model is simpler with a single construct that will always allow a remark. Names and values that were allowed on annotations are now allowed on properties.</li><li><code>latest-version</code>, <code>predecessor-version</code>, and <code>successor-version</code> link relations were added to allow an OSCAL document to link to latest, previous, and next document revisions.</li><li>Markup content may now contain data insertion points for data other than parameters. The <code>insert</code> object, which may appear in markup content strings, now supports a <code>type</code> which can be used to indicate the type of data to insert, and an <code>id-ref</code> that identifies the specific data object to take data from.</li></ul><h3 id=model-specific-changes>Model-Specific Changes</h3><h4 id=catalog-and-profile>Catalog and Profile</h4><ul><li>Remarks were added to <code>param</code> declarations.</li><li>The import/insert structure in OSCAL profiles has been updated to align with the include/exclude syntax used in the assessment models. This lays the groundwork for more dynamic extension and expansion of include/exclude capabilities in future releases.</li></ul><h4 id=component-definition>Component Definition</h4><ul><li><code>set-parameter</code> was added to <code>/component-definition/component(s)//control-implementations</code> to allow for parameter values to be more conveniently defined for all control implementations.</li></ul><h4 id=assessment-plan-and-assessment-results>Assessment Plan and Assessment Results</h4><ul><li>The concepts of task and action were combined, resulting in only the concept of a task. A task now has a type, which defines if the task is a &ldquo;milestone&rdquo; or &ldquo;action&rdquo;. This resulted in the following changes:<ul><li><code>/assessment-results/results/local-definitions/action(s)</code> was removed.</li><li><code>/assessment-results/results/assessment-log/entry/related-action(s)</code> was removed.</li><li>A task can now define a <code>dependency</code> on another task.</li></ul></li><li>In multiple locations <code>assessment-subject</code> has been renamed to <code>subject</code> to be more consistent. Before there was a mixture of names.</li><li>In JSON the <code>/assessment-plan/terms-and-conditions//parts</code> is always an array. In RC1, if a single part object was provided, the value was a single object.</li><li>In JSON the <code>/assessment-results/local-definitions/add-objectives-and-methods</code> was renamed to &ldquo;objectives-and-methods&rdquo;. Similarly, in XML <code>/assessment-results/local-definitions/add-objectives-and-methods</code> was renamed to &ldquo;objectives-and-methods&rdquo;.</li><li>In JSON and XML <code>/assessment-results/results/local-definitions/assessment-assets</code> has been added to allow each result to declare which assessment assets were used during the assessment, if these assets differ from what was defined in the assessment plan. This construct was moved from <code>/assessment-results/results</code>.</li><li>In JSON and XML <code>/assessment-results/results/assessment-subject</code> has been removed. This was originally used to add subjects that were not found in the assessment plan or SSP. In <code>/assessment-results/results/local-definitions</code> you can specify <code>component(s)</code>, <code>inventory-item(s)</code>, and <code>user(s)</code> definitions. These allow the identification of subjects that are not in the assessment plan or SSP, making <code>assessment-subject</code> unneeded.</li><li>In <code>/assessment-results/results/finding</code> the <code>collected</code> and <code>expires</code> was removed, since this is an aspect of the observation, not the finding.</li><li>In <code>/assessment-results/results/finding</code> the <code>objective-status</code> has been replaced by <code>finding-target</code> which can now be used to provide a status on a per-subject basis. This allows a finding to be associated with multiple related subjects that might have different states.</li></ul><h2 id=oscal-100-release-candidate-1>OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate 1</h2><p>The following changes were made in OSCAL 1.0.0 Release Candidate (RC) 1 since OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 3.</p><p>Changes in this release have been focused on the following major areas:</p><ul><li>Making naming in XML and JSON/YAML more consistent.</li><li>Ensuring that all data types and cardinalities are appropriate.</li><li>Refactoring to cleanup models, making them: 1) more consistent with the other OSCAL models, 2) making them more simple when possible, and 3) providing room for future addition of new features.</li></ul><h3 id=changes-common-to-all-models-1>Changes common to all models</h3><ul><li>many elements in XML, and properties in JSON and YAML, have been renamed to make the naming more consistent between elements names in XML and property names in JSON and YAML. Now JSON properties that contain an array of objects use a plural form of the XML element name. The one exception is &ldquo;prop&rdquo; in XML vs &ldquo;properties&rdquo; in JSON and YAML. This decision was made to make the XML use of &ldquo;prop&rdquo; more concise, since &ldquo;prop&rdquo; elements are used a good deal in OSCAL XML formats.</li></ul><h4 id=changes-to-all-xml-formats>Changes to all XML formats</h4><p>In {top-level-element}/metadata:</p><ul><li>renamed &ldquo;revision-history&rdquo; to &ldquo;revisions&rdquo;</li><li>renamed &ldquo;doc-id&rdquo; to &ldquo;document-id&rdquo;</li></ul><p>In {top-level-element}/metadata/document-id:</p><ul><li>renamed &ldquo;type&rdquo; to &ldquo;scheme&rdquo;</li></ul><p>In {top-level-element}/metadata/link:</p><ul><li>Defined allowed values for the &ldquo;rel&rdquo; property</li></ul><p>In {top-level-element}/metadata/location:</p><ul><li>renamed &ldquo;email&rdquo; to &ldquo;email-address&rdquo;</li><li>renamed &ldquo;phone&rdquo; to &ldquo;telephone-number&rdquo;</li></ul><p>In {top-level-element}/metadata/location/prop:</p><ul><li>Defined allowed values for the &ldquo;name&rdquo; attribute.

Its value must be a date-time with time zone (i.e., a timestamp). The old element <code>last-modified-date</code> is no longer permitted.</li><li><code>published</code> is permitted for a nominal publication date, as assigned by the owner or publisher of the catalog or resource. An electronic version of a previously published catalog should carry its own publication date, if any, not that of the original resource (which can be described elsewhere with its own metadata).</li><li><code>role-id</code> is now assigned as an element in the XML, not an attribute. This permits it to be tokenized more explicitly.</li></ul><h4 id=control-structures-in-the-catalog-model>Control structures in the catalog model</h4><h5 id=new-property-in-sp800-53-catalog-data>New property in SP800-53 catalog data</h5><p>In the SP800-53 catalog, we have added a property called <code>sort-id</code> to controls and enhancements. Its string value represents the control&rsquo;s ID in a (zero-padded) notation that will sort gracefully against other <code>sort-id</code> values. This permits a robust reordering of controls in receiving systems without having to refer to an out-of-line document to restore the canonical order.</p><h5 id=controls-inside-controls-but-no-subcontrols>Controls inside controls, but no &ldquo;subcontrols&rdquo;</h5><p>Control enhancements are now represented using <code>control</code> not <code>subcontrol</code>. The advantages of restricting to two levels of hierarchy (even given groups and parts) became too few in view of the sacrifices to expressiveness so we have gone back to clean recursion.</p><h4 id=data-type-handling>Data type handling</h4><p>Data type handling has been extended in several respects to provide for the validating of lexical forms of nominal datatypes. Datatypes for dates and times have been added. Several XML-peculiar datatypes have been removed.</p><h5 id=value-enumeration-on-terminal-nodes>Value enumeration on terminal nodes</h5><p>The schema has also been extended to support validation against enumerated values, either exclusively (only declared values may appear) or inclusively (enumerations are documented while other values are also permitted). All allowed values now being declared (Milestone 2) are inclusive of other values (user- or application-defined), so this is not a breaking change.</p><p>Affected data points (in both models): <code>prop/name</code>, <code>address/type</code>, <code>phone/type</code>, <code>hash/algorithm</code>, <code>role-id</code>. The enumerated values provided for each are documented.</p><h5 id=lexical-datatyping-at-points>Lexical datatyping at points</h5><p>Supported for lexical datatyping has also been added to <code>link/href</code>, <code>rlink/href</code> (URI references), <code>published</code> and <code>last-modified</code> (timestamps), <code>email</code> (a nominal email address), <code>url</code> (a URI), <code>img/src</code>.</p><h4 id=profile-model-enhancements>Profile model enhancements</h4><h5 id=calling-control-enhancements-old-subcontrols>Calling control enhancements (old &ldquo;subcontrols&rdquo;)</h5><p>From call statements, since <code>subcontrol</code> has been dropped from the catalog model, <code>subcontrol-id</code> has been replaced with <code>control-id</code>, and <code>with-subcontrols</code> has been replaced by <code>with-child-controls</code> (on <code>call</code>, <code>all</code> and <code>match</code>). Essentially, a subcontrol is now represented as a control that is a child another parent control.</p><h5 id=expanded-model-for-new-groups>Expanded model for new groups</h5><p>Elements besides control references are now permitted inside <code>group</code> within the <code>merge</code> construct, so profile authors can provide titles and introductory content to groups they define for their represented aggregate control structures.</p><h5 id=parameter-settings>Parameter settings</h5><p>Added &lsquo;guideline&rsquo; to profile model. It was omitted in error.</p><p>See issues #494, #288 (adding &lsquo;guideline&rsquo; to profile model)</p><h2 id=oscal-100-milestone-1>OSCAL 1.0.0 Milestone 1</h2><p>&ndash;</p><ul><li>The first official OSCAL release</li><li>Provides stable versions of the OSCAL catalog and profile models in XML and JSON formats, along with associated XML and JSON schemas.</li><li>Includes draft versions of the NIST SP 800-53 revision 4 OSCAL content and FedRAMP baselines in OSCAL XML, JSON, and YAML formats.</li><li>Provides content converters that are capable of accurately converting between OSCAL catalog and profile content in OSCAL XML to OSCAL JSON format and vice versa.</li></ul></article></div><nav aria-label="Table of Contents" class="toc-container usa-layout-docs__sidenav widescreen:grid-col-2 desktop:grid-col-2"><div id=js-toc></div></nav></div></div></main><p class="font-sans-sm text-center" style="margin:1.5rem auto">This page was last updated on June 27, 2023.</p><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tocbot/4.12.0/tocbot.min.js integrity=sha384-roIHE2HuL+PZHzo8X7MgpHu256WMUJvsKqI2GaUJY3moVp06oLtx0QvZnvZJdcCb crossorigin=anonymous referrerpolicy=no-referrer></script>
